# **Unlocking the Power of RAG with Gemini: Building AI That Thinks Smarter**

Welcome to the **Unlocking the Power of RAG with Gemini: Building AI That Thinks Smarter** repository!  
This project is inspired by my participation in the **GDG DevFest 2024** workshop on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), conducted by the amazing **Rashika Karki**.  

During this workshop, I learned how to leverage **Google Gemini** to build smarter AI systems. This repository is designed to help you start your own RAG journey.
